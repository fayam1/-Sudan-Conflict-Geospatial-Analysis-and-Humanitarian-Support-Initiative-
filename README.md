# Sudan Conflict Geospatial Analysis and Humanitarian Support 
The Sudan Conflict Response GIS Analysis project is an independent initiative addressing the humanitarian crisis stemming from the April 2023 conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). This project utilizes Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and advanced data analysis techniques to provide critical insights into the conflict's impact, including infrastructure damage and population displacement. The primary goal is to support humanitarian organizations with data-driven information for effective decision-making and resource allocation.

## Project Objectives:
- Utilize the ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data) API to access up-to-date conflict data

- Employ Python and Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning and advanced analysis

- Map and quantify areas affected by explosive hazards across Sudan

- Analyze the spatial distribution and size of suspected battlefields from armed clash incidents

- Identify the most affected states by explosive hazards and armed clashes

- Categorize types of explosive hazards and their prevalence

- Assess IDP numbers and displacement patterns

## Project outcomes:

- Comprehensive maps of explosive hazard contamination and suspected battlefield areas

- Analysis of the most affected states by explosive hazards and armed clashes

- Categorization of explosive hazard types and their percentages

- Detailed assessment of IDP distribution and numbers dashboard

An interactive map visualizing suspected battlefields and explosive hazard contamination across Sudan (January 2023 - June 2024)

- Data-driven insights to enhance crisis response strategies for organizations such as the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) and Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD)

These outcomes aim to support humanitarian efforts, aid in effective decision-making, and contribute to the development of targeted crisis response strategies in Sudan.
